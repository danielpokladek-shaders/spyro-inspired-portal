# Template Project (Unity)

Simple Unity project template for experimenting (URP-ready).

Template comes with:

- Simple first person controller.
- Scene with a room and colliders set up.
- Prototyping materials/textures.

## Requirements

- Unity (see `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` for the exact editor version used by this project)

## Getting started

1. Open Unity Hub
2. Add this folder as a project
3. Open the project in the matching Unity version

## Where to look

- `Assets/Project/` — project-specific content (scenes, materials, shaders, scripts)
- `Assets/Shared/` — shared/reusable assets
- `Packages/manifest.json` — package dependencies (URP, Shader Graph, etc.)
- `ProjectSettings/` — Unity project settings

## Notes

- If you’re on URP: check `ProjectSettings/GraphicsSettings.asset` and `ProjectSettings/QualitySettings.asset` to confirm the active render pipeline asset.
- Unity’s `Library/` folder is generated locally and should not be edited manually.
